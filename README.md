# Ch10-Simulator
I added in coyotes that will hunt down and eat foxes.
They breed quite often and dont eat often.
This is so they dont die out trying to find a fox with all the rabbits in the way.
It took a lot of adjusting of each animal so that they will all survive the simulation.
Now they all survive and during my tests the foxes will have a higher population than the coyotes
most of the time.
